# Nibbles - Enumeration

---

There are 201 standalone boxes of various operating systems and difficulty levels available to us on the HTB platform with VIP membership when writing this. This membership includes an official HTB created walkthrough for each retired machine. We can also find blog and video walkthroughs for most boxes with a quick Google search.

For our purposes, let us walk through the box `Nibbles`, an easy-rated Linux box that showcases common enumeration tactics, basic web application exploitation, and a file-related misconfiguration to escalate privileges.

[Nibbles machine details: Linux OS, Easy difficulty, 20 points, released on 13 Jan 2018, IP 10.10.10.75.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/77/nibbles_card.png)

Let us first look at some machine statistics:

Our first step when approaching any machine is to perform some basic enumeration. First, let us start with what we do know about the target. We already know the target's IP address, that it is Linux, and has a web-related attack vector. We call this a grey-box approach because we have some information about the target. On the HTB platform, the 20 "active" weekly-release machines are all approached from a black-box perspective. Users are given the IP address and operating system type beforehand but no additional information about the target to formulate their attacks. This is why the thorough enumeration is critical and is often an iterative process.

Before we continue, let us take a quick step back and look at the various approaches to penetration testing actions. There are three main types, `black-box`, `grey-box`, and `white-box`, and each differs in the goal and approach.

| **Engagement** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Black-Box`    | Low level to no knowledge of a target. The penetration tester must perform in-depth reconnaissance to learn about the target. This may be an external penetration test where the tester is given only the company name and no further information such as target IP addresses, or an internal penetration test where the tester either has to bypass controls to gain initial access to the network or can connect to the internal network but has no information about internal networks/hosts. This type of penetration test most simulates an actual attack but is not as comprehensive as other assessment types and could leave misconfigurations/vulnerabilities undiscovered. |
| `Grey-Box`     | In a grey-box test, the tester is given a certain amount of information in advance. This may be a list of in-scope IP addresses/ranges, low-level credentials to a web application or Active Directory, or some application/network diagrams. This type of penetration test can simulate a malicious insider or see what an attacker can do with a low level of access. In this scenario, the tester will typically spend less time on reconnaissance and more time looking for misconfigurations and attempting exploitation.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `White-Box`    | In this type of test, the tester is given complete access. In a web application test, they may be provided with administrator-level credentials, access to the source code, build diagrams, etc., to look for logic vulnerabilities and other difficult-to-discover flaws. In a network test, they may be given administrator-level credentials to dig into Active Directory or other systems for misconfigurations that may otherwise be missed. This assessment type is highly comprehensive as the tester will have access to both sides of a target and perform a comprehensive analysis.                                                                                        |

## Nmap

Let us begin with a quick `nmap` scan to look for open ports using the command `nmap -sV --open -oA nibbles_initial_scan <ip address>`. This will run a service enumeration (`-sV`) scan against the default top 1,000 ports and only return open ports (`--open`). We can check which ports `nmap` scans for a given scan type by running a scan with no target specified, using the command `nmap -v -oG -`. Here we will output the greppable format to stdout with `-oG -` and `-v` for verbose output. Since no target is specified, the scan will fail but will show the ports scanned.

```

```

Finally, we will output all scan formats using `-oA`. This includes XML output, greppable output, and text output that may be useful to us later. It is essential to get in the habit of taking extensive notes and saving all console output early on. The better we get at this while practicing, the more second nature it will become when on real-world engagements. Proper notetaking is critical for us as penetration testers and will significantly speed up the reporting process and ensure no evidence is lost. It is also essential to keep detailed time-stamped logs of scanning and exploitation attempts in an outage or incident in which the client needs information about our activities.

```

From the initial scan output, we can see that the host is likely Ubuntu Linux and exposes an Apache web server on port 80 and an OpenSSH server on port 22. SSH, or [Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_\(Secure_Shell\)), is a protocol typically used for remote access to Linux/Unix hosts. SSH can also be used to access Windows host and is now native to Windows 10 since version 1809. We can also see that all three types of scan output were created in our working directory.

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ ls

nibbles_initial_scan.gnmap  nibbles_initial_scan.nmap  nibbles_initial_scan.xml


```

Before we start poking around at the open ports, we can run a full TCP port scan using the command `nmap -p- --open -oA nibbles_full_tcp_scan 10.129.42.190`. This will check for any services running on non-standard ports that our initial scan may have missed. Since this scans all 65,535 TCP ports, it can take a long time to finish depending on the network. We can leave this running in the background and move on with our enumeration. Using `nc` to do some banner grabbing confirms what `nmap` told us; the target is running an Apache web server and an OpenSSH server.

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.42.190 22

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.190] 22 (ssh) open
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.8


```

`nc` tells us that port 80 runs an HTTP (web) server but does not show the banner.

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.42.190 80

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.190] 80 (http) open


```

Checking our other terminal window, we can see that the full port scan (`-p-`) has finished and has not found any additional ports. Let's do perform an `nmap` [script](https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html) scan using the `-sC` flag. This flag uses the default scripts, which are listed [here](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/default.html). These scripts can be intrusive, so it is always important to understand exactly how our tools work. We run the command `nmap -sC -p 22,80 -oA nibbles_script_scan 10.129.42.190`. Since we already know which ports are open, we can save time and limit unnecessary scanner traffic by specifying the target ports with `-p`.

```

The script scan did not give us anything handy. Let us round out our `nmap` enumeration using the [http-enum script](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html), which can be used to enumerate common web application directories. This scan also did not uncover anything useful.

```

# Nibbles - Web Footprinting

---

We can use `whatweb` to try to identify the web application in use.

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ whatweb 10.129.42.190

http://10.129.42.190 [200 OK] Apache[2.4.18], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.129.42.190]


```

This tool does not identify any standard web technologies in use. Browsing to the target in `Firefox` shows us a simple "Hello world!" message.

[Text 'Hello world!' displayed on a white background.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/77/nibbles_hello2.png)

Checking the page source reveals an interesting comment.

[HTML code snippet with 'Hello world!' in bold and a comment about the /nibbleblog/ directory.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/77/nibbles_comment1.png)

We can also check this with cURL.

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ curl http://10.129.42.190

<b>Hello world!</b>

<!-- /nibbleblog/ directory. Nothing interesting here! -->


```

The HTML comment mentions a directory named `nibbleblog`. Let us check this with `whatweb`.

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ whatweb http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog

http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog [301 Moved Permanently] Apache[2.4.18], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.129.42.190], RedirectLocation[http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/], Title[301 Moved Permanently]
http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/ [200 OK] Apache[2.4.18], Cookies[PHPSESSID], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.129.42.190], JQuery, MetaGenerator[Nibbleblog], PoweredBy[Nibbleblog], Script, Title[Nibbles - Yum yum]


```

Now we are starting to get a better picture of things. We can see some of the technologies in use such as [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery), and [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP). We can also see that the site is running [Nibbleblog](https://www.nibbleblog.com/), which is a free blogging engine built using PHP.

## Directory Enumeration

Browsing to the `/nibbleblog` directory in `Firefox`, we do not see anything exciting on the main page.

[Blog page titled 'Nibbles Yum yum' with no posts, categories, and links to 'Home' and 'Powered by Nibbleblog'.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/77/yumyum_.png)

A quick Google search for "nibbleblog exploit" yields this [Nibbleblog File Upload Vulnerability](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload/). The flaw allows an authenticated attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the underlying web server. The `Metasploit` module in question works for version `4.0.3`. We do not know the exact version of `Nibbleblog` in use yet, but it is a good bet that it is vulnerable to this. If we look at the source code of the `Metasploit` module, we can see that the exploit uses user-supplied credentials to authenticate the admin portal at `/admin.php`.

Let us use [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) to be thorough and check for any other accessible pages/directories.

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ gobuster dir -u http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/ --wordlist /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

```

`Gobuster` finishes very quickly and confirms the presence of the `admin.php` page. We can check the `README` page for interesting information, such as the version number.

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ curl http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/README

```

So we validate that version 4.0.3 is in use, confirming that this version is likely vulnerable to the `Metasploit` module (though this could be an old `README` page). Nothing else interesting pops out at us. Let us check out the admin portal login page.

[Login form for Nibbleblog admin area with fields for username, password, 'Remember me' checkbox, and 'Back to blog' link.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/77/nibble_admin.png)

Now, to use the exploit mentioned above, we will need valid admin credentials. We can try some authorization bypass techniques and common credential pairs manually, such as `admin:admin` and `admin:password`, to no avail. There is a reset password function, but we receive an e-mail error. Also, too many login attempts too quickly trigger a lockout with the message `Nibbleblog security error - Blacklist protection`.

Let us go back to our directory brute-forcing results. The `200` status codes show pages/directories that are directly accessible. The `403` status codes in the output indicate that access to these resources is forbidden. Finally, the `301` is a permanent redirect. Let us explore each of these. Browsing to `nibbleblog/themes/`. We can see that directory listing is enabled on the web application. Maybe we can find something interesting while poking around?

[Directory listing of /nibbleblog/themes with folders: echo, medium, note-2, simpler, techie.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/77/nibbles_dir_listing.png)

Browsing to `nibbleblog/content` shows some interesting subdirectories `public`, `private`, and `tmp`. Digging around for a while, we find a `users.xml` file which at least seems to confirm the username is indeed admin. It also shows blacklisted IP addresses. We can request this file with `cURL` and prettify the `XML` output using [xmllint](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xmllint).

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ curl -s http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/content/private/users.xml | xmllint  --format -

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<users>
  <user username="admin">
    <id type="integer">0</id>
    <session_fail_count type="integer">2</session_fail_count>
    <session_date type="integer">1608182184</session_date>
  </user>
  <blacklist type="string" ip="10.10.10.1">
    <date type="integer">1512964659</date>
    <fail_count type="integer">1</fail_count>
  </blacklist>
  <blacklist type="string" ip="10.10.14.2">
    <date type="integer">1608182171</date>
    <fail_count type="integer">5</fail_count>
  </blacklist>
</users>


```

At this point, we have a valid username but no password. Searches of Nibbleblog related documentation show that the password is set during installation, and there is no known default password. Up to this point, have the following pieces of the puzzle:

- A Nibbleblog install potentially vulnerable to an authenticated file upload vulnerability
- An admin portal at `nibbleblog/admin.php`
- Directory listing which confirmed that `admin` is a valid username
- Login brute-forcing protection blacklists our IP address after too many invalid login attempts. This takes login brute-forcing with a tool such as [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) off the table

There are no other ports open, and we did not find any other directories. Which we can confirm by performing additional directory brute-forcing against the root of the web application

```
        shellsession
rohitsah@htb[/htb]$ gobuster dir -u http://10.129.42.190/ --wordlist /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

Taking another look through all of the exposed directories, we find a `config.xml` file.

Checking it, hoping for passwords proofs fruitless, but we do see two mentions of `nibbles` in the site title as well as the notification e-mail address. This is also the name of the box. Could this be the admin password?

When performing password cracking offline with a tool such as `Hashcat` or attempting to guess a password, it is important to consider all of the information in front of us. It is not uncommon to successfully crack a password hash (such as a company's wireless network passphrase) using a wordlist generated by crawling their website using a tool such as [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL).

[Nibbleblog dashboard with options to publish, manage, and settings. Notifications show session starts and login attempts.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/77/nibbles_loggedin.png)

This shows us how crucial thorough enumeration is. Let us recap what we have found so far:

- We started with a simple `nmap` scan showing two open ports
- Discovered an instance of `Nibbleblog`
- Analyzed the technologies in use using `whatweb`
- Found the admin login portal page at `admin.php`
- Discovered that directory listing is enabled and browsed several directories
- Confirmed that `admin` was the valid username
- Found out the hard way that IP blacklisting is enabled to prevent brute-force login attempts
- Uncovered clues that led us to a valid admin password of nibbles

This proves that we need a clear, repeatable process that we will use time and time again, no matter if we are attacking a single box on HTB, performing a web application penetration test for a client, or attacking a large Active Directory environment. Keep in mind that iterative enumeration, along with detailed notetaking, is one of the keys to success in this field. As you progress in your career, you will often marvel at how the initial scope of a penetration test seemed extremely small and "boring," yet once you dig in and perform rounds and rounds of enumeration and peel back the layers, you may find an exposed service on a high port or some forgotten page or directory that can lead to sensitive data exposure or even a foothold.
